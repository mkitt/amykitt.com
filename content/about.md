# Amy Kitt

hello. I am a freelance designer with a focus on branding + identity.

From concept to build-out, or stepping into a project in the middle, I enjoy
collaboration with agencies, small design shops, organizations and independent
companies/individuals. I mostly park my laptop in Denver, CO where Mansfield, my
super grumpy 11-year old Bernese Mountain Dog acts as office manager. (He gets
paid in belly rubs & biscuits). When Iâ€™m not designing I snowboard, snowshoe,
x-country ski, do yoga and wog (jog very slowly). 

## Discipline Strengths
icon + symbol design  
branding/visual design language  
print + collateral design  
interactive   

## Brand Highlights
Aspen/Snowmass, Audi of America, Backyard Soda Co., Boa Technology, Brine Lacrosse, Burton Snowboards, Callaway Golf, Copper Mountain, Eagle Creek, Gregory Packs, Instagram, John Huet Photography, MCA Denver, Muse Studio, The North Face, Oakley, POWDR Co., Pressery, Red Camper, Revo, Scarpa, Vail Resorts, Vans, Westword, Winter Park/Mary Jane
