# Amy Kitt

hello. I am a freelance designer with a focus on branding + identity.

From concept to build-out, or stepping into a project in the middle, I enjoy
collaboration with agencies, small design shops, organizations and independent
companies/individuals. I mostly park my laptop in Denver, CO. When I’m not
designing I snowboard, snowshoe, x-country ski, do yoga and wog (jog very
slowly).
