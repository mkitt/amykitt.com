# Amy Kitt

hello. I am a freelance designer with a focus on branding + identity.

From concept to build-out, or stepping into a project in the middle, I enjoy
collaboration with agencies, small design shops, organizations and independent
companies/individuals. I mostly park my laptop in Denver, CO where Mansfield, my
super grumpy 11-year old Bernese Mountain Dog acts as office manager. (He gets
paid in belly rubs & biscuits). When Iâ€™m not designing I snowboard, snowshoe,
x-country ski, do yoga and wog (jog very slowly). 

## Discipline Strengths
- icon + symbol design
- branding/visual design language
- print + collateral design
- interactive
