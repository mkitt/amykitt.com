{"about":{"title":"About","body":"\n![Amy Kitt](https://d194i88zucrucp.cloudfront.net/amy-kitt.jpg)\n\n# Amy Kitt\n\nhello. I am a freelance designer with a focus on branding + identity.\n\nFrom concept to build-out, or stepping into a project in the middle, I enjoy\ncollaboration with agencies, small design shops, organizations and independent\ncompanies/individuals. I mostly park my laptop in Denver, CO where Mansfield, my\nsuper grumpy 11-year old Bernese Mountain Dog acts as office manager. (He gets\npaid in belly rubs & biscuits). When Iâ€™m not designing I snowboard, snowshoe,\nx-country ski, do yoga and wog (jog very slowly). \n\n## Discipline Strengths\nicon + symbol design  \nbranding/visual design language  \nprint + collateral design  \ninteractive   \n\n## Brand Highlights\nAspen/Snowmass, Audi of America, Backyard Soda Co., Boa Technology, Brine Lacrosse, Burton Snowboards, Callaway Golf, Copper Mountain, Eagle Creek, Gregory Packs, Instagram, John Huet Photography, MCA Denver, Muse Studio, The North Face, Oakley, POWDR Co., Pressery, Red Camper, Revo, Scarpa, Vail Resorts, Vans, Westword, Winter Park/Mary Jane\n","id":"about"}}
