{"about":{"title":"About","body":"\n# Amy Kitt\n\n![Amy Kitt](https://d194i88zucrucp.cloudfront.net/amy-kitt.jpg)\n\nhello. I am a freelance designer with a focus on branding + identity.\n\nFrom concept to build-out, or stepping into a project in the middle, I enjoy collaboration with agencies, small design shops, organizations and independent companies/individuals. I mostly park my laptop in Denver, CO where Mansfield, my super grumpy 11-year old Bernese Mountain Dog acts as office manager. (He gets paid in belly rubs & biscuits). When Iâ€™m not designing I snowboard, snowshoe, x-country ski, do yoga and wog (jog very slowly). \n\nDISCIPLINE STRENGTHS\nicon + symbol design\nbranding/visual design language\nprint + collateral design\ninteractive \n","id":"about"}}
