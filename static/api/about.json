{"about":{"title":"About","body":"\n![Amy Kitt](https://d194i88zucrucp.cloudfront.net/amy-kitt.jpg)\n\n# Amy Kitt\n\nhello. I am a freelance designer with a focus on branding + identity.\n\nFrom concept to build-out, or stepping into a project in the middle, I enjoy\ncollaboration with agencies, small design shops, organizations and independent\ncompanies/individuals. I mostly park my laptop in Denver, CO where Mansfield, my\nsuper grumpy 11-year old Bernese Mountain Dog acts as office manager. (He gets\npaid in belly rubs & biscuits). When Iâ€™m not designing I snowboard, snowshoe,\nx-country ski, do yoga and wog (jog very slowly). \n\n## Discipline Strengths\n- icon + symbol design\n- branding/visual design language\n- print + collateral design\n- interactive \n","id":"about"}}
